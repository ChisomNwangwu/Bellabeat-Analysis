## About the company ##

Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

## The Ask Phase ##
* **Identify Business task**

The company targets their marketing efforts into their customer’s needs based on the usage of their fitness smart devices. With this info, they can then make high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

*	**Consider key stakeholders**

The main stakeholders here are Urška Sršen, Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer; Sando Mur, Mathematician and Bellabeat’s co founder; And the rest of the Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

*	**Business Task**

Given these facts, the business task is to identify trends in how consumers use Bellabeat smart devices to gain and apply insights that could be used to orientate marketing decisions. So, in one phrase it would be:
*How do our users use our smart devices?*

## Prepare dataset ##

*	**Data set used:**

The data source used for this case study is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This data set is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.

*	**Accessibility and privacy of data:**

Verifying from the metadata of this data set, we can confirm it is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

*	**Information about our data set:**

These data sets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

*	**Data Organization and verification:**

Available to us are 18 CSV documents. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit. The data is considered long since each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.

*	**Data Credibility and Integrity:**

Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the data set is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2 months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational approach.

## Process data set ##

I will focus this analysis in R due to the accessibility, amount of data and to be able to create data visualization to share my results with stakeholders.

*	**Installing packages and opening libraries**

I will use the following packages for this analysis:

1.	tidyverse

2.	janitor

3.	lubridate

4.	skimr

5.	scales


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
library(scales)
```

* **Importing datasets**

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
calories <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
intensities <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
steps <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/dailySteps_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
sleep <- read.csv("~/Data Analysis/sleepDay_merged.csv")

```

* **Previewing datasets to ensure they were imported correctly**

```{r}
head(activity)
head(calories)
head(intensities)
head(steps)
head(sleep)
head(weight)
```

## Data Cleaning ##

spotted some inconsistencies in date format, so I’m going to format the dates so they are consistent.
I’m going to start off by separating the SleepDay column in the sleep data set into two columns.

```{r}
sleep <- separate(sleep, SleepDay, into = c('date', 'time'), sep = ' ')
```

**Formatting dates so they are consistent**


```{r}
activity <- activity %>%
  rename(date = ActivityDate) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y" ))
colnames(activity)
```


```{r}
calories <- calories %>%
  rename(date = ActivityDay) %>%
  mutate(date =as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
head(calories)
```

```{r}
intensities <- intensities %>%
  rename(date = ActivityDay) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format ="%m/%d/%Y"))
```

```{r}
steps <- steps %>%
  rename(date = ActivityDay) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format ="%m/%d/%Y"))
```


```{r}
sleep <- sleep %>%
  rename(date = date) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format ="%m/%d/%Y"))
```


```{r}
weight <- weight %>%
  rename(date = Date) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"))
```


The date formats are now consistent.
I also noticed that the column names have a mix of uppercase and lower case which may lead to errors in this analysis, the column names all need to be in lowercase.

**Clean and rename columns**


```{r}
activity <- rename_with(activity, tolower)
```


```{r}
calories <- rename_with(calories, tolower)
```


```{r}
intensities <- rename_with(intensities, tolower)
```


```{r}
steps <- rename_with(steps, tolower)
```


```{r}
sleep <- rename_with(sleep, tolower)
```


```{r}
weight <- rename_with(weight, tolower)
```
## Data Exploration ##

**Verifying unique number of members**

```{r}
n_distinct(activity$id)
n_distinct(calories$id)
n_distinct(intensities$id)
n_distinct(steps$id)
n_distinct(sleep$id)
n_distinct(weight$id)
```
There are 33 participants in the activity, calories, intensities and steps data sets, 24 in the sleep data set and only 8 in the weight data set. As recommended by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the field of probability and statistics, the minimum recommended sample size is 30. Since as sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid.
The weight data set contains very little number of participants which may cause sampling bias in this analysis


**Checking for Nulls**

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
sum(is.na(calories))
sum(is.na(intensities))
sum(is.na(steps))
sum(is.na(sleep))
sum(is.na(weight))
```
The weight data set contains too many blank spaces, we will have to drop this data set to avoid bias in this analysis

**Checking for duplicates**

```{r}
sum(duplicated(activity))
sum(duplicated(calories))
sum(duplicated(intensities))
sum(duplicated(steps))
sum(duplicated(sleep))
```

The sleep data set contains 3 duplicates, these duplicates are going to be deleted.

**Removing Duplicates**

```{r}
sleep <- sleep %>%
  distinct() %>%
  drop_na
```

**checking for duplicates in the new sleep data set**


```{r}
sum(duplicated(sleep))
```

Let’s take a glimpse at our now clean data sets before we summarize

```{r}
glimpse(activity)
```

```{r}
glimpse(calories)
```

```{r}
glimpse(intensities)
```

```{r}
glimpse(steps)
```

```{r}
glimpse(sleep)
```


```{r}
activity %>%  
  select(totalsteps, totaldistance, sedentaryminutes, calories) %>%
  summary()
```

**Summarizing data sets**

* Activity

```{r}
activity %>%  
  select(totalsteps, totaldistance, sedentaryminutes, calories) %>%
  summary()

```

*	Explore number of active minutes per category

```{r}
activity %>%
  select(veryactiveminutes, fairlyactiveminutes, lightlyactiveminutes) %>%
  summary()
```

* Calories

```{r}
calories %>%
  select(calories) %>%
  summary()
```

* Sleep

```{r}
sleep %>%
  select(totalsleeprecords, totalminutesasleep, totaltimeinbed) %>%
  summary()
```


## Data Analysis ##

**Before visualization, I’ll merge all my data into one data set**


```{r}
activity_calories_merged <- merge(activity, calories, by=c("id", "date", "calories"))
act_cal_int_merged <- merge(activity_calories_merged, intensities, by=c("id","date","sedentaryminutes", "lightlyactiveminutes", "fairlyactiveminutes", "veryactiveminutes", "sedentaryactivedistance", "lightactivedistance", "moderatelyactivedistance", "veryactivedistance"))
act_cal_int_sleep_merged <- merge(act_cal_int_merged, sleep, by=c("id","date")) %>%
  select(id, date, time, sedentaryminutes, lightlyactiveminutes, fairlyactiveminutes, veryactiveminutes, sedentaryactivedistance, lightactivedistance, moderatelyactivedistance, veryactivedistance, calories, totalsteps, totaldistance, trackerdistance, loggedactivitiesdistance, totalsleeprecords, totalminutesasleep, totaltimeinbed)
all_data_merged <- act_cal_int_sleep_merged
```


**let’s take a look at our merged data summary**


```{r}
summary(all_data_merged)
```


**Let’s begin some basic analysis to verify the behavior of data.**


Hypothetically speaking, there is a positive correlation between activity level (total steps in this case) and calorie burning, so we will make some visuals to examine these hypothesis.


**Relationship between steps and calories**


```{r}
ggplot(data = all_data_merged) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=sedentaryminutes, y=totalminutesasleep))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=sedentaryminutes, y=totalminutesasleep))+
  labs(title = "SedentaryMinutes vs TotalMinutesAsleep", subtitle = "Negative correlation between sedentary minutes and sleep by 'fitbit' users", caption="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")+
  annotate("text", x=250, y=100, label="Negative correlation", color="blue", size=4)
```


This chart confirms our hypothesis that there is a strong positive correlation between the steps taken and calories burned. As a result we need to dive deeper to understand more from this data. We will now go ahead to analyze the total steps taken in weekdays to verify which days are desired to take walks.


**Activities in weekdays**


```{r}
ggplot(data = sleep) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=totaltimeinbed, y=totalminutesasleep)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=totaltimeinbed, y=totalminutesasleep)) +
  labs(title="Total Time in Bed vs. Total Minutes Asleep", subtitle = "Positive correlation between total time in bed and total time asleep by 'fitbit' users", caption="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")+
  annotate("text", x=750, y=100, label="Positive correlation", color="blue", size=4)
```


The data provided by these devices are showing us that Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s have the most active hours based on the steps that users have recorded, as we can see on the chart; Now, let’s verify if we will see the same trend with the calorie-burning records.





```{r}
ggplot(data = all_data_merged) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=totalsteps, y=calories)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = totalsteps, y=calories)) +
  labs(title="Total Steps vs. Calories Burned", subtitle = "Positive correlation between totalsteps taken and calories burned in 'fitbit' users", caption="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")+
  annotate("text", x=17500, y=500, label="Positive correlation", color="blue", size=4)
```




```{r}
ggplot(data = all_data_merged) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=totaldistance, y=calories)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=totaldistance, y=calories)) +
  labs(title="Total Distance vs. Calories Burned", subtitle ="Positive correlation between totaldistance and calories burned in 'fitit' users", caption="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")+
  annotate("text", x=13, y=500, label="Positive correlation", color="blue", size=4)
```

**Activities and calorie burns weekly**

```{r}
activity %>%
  mutate(weekdays = weekdays(date)) %>%
  select(weekdays, totalsteps) %>%
  mutate(weekdays = factor(weekdays, levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'))) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x=weekdays, y=totalsteps, fill='green'))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="BrBG")+
  labs(title = "Weekday Activity Counter", caption ="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")
```


```{r}
activity %>%
  mutate(weekdays = weekdays(date)) %>%
  select(weekdays, calories) %>%
  mutate(weekdays = factor(weekdays, levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'))) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x=weekdays, y=calories, fill=weekdays))+
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(title = "Weekdays Activity Counter", caption ="Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk")
```
This chart does not exactly back our hypothesis, it shows that calories are burned the most on Thursday’s whereas we there is more activity done on Tuesday’s in the previous chart. What this tells us is that there are other elements involved in calorie burning during the day and as a result, the correlation between total calorie burning and total steps taken on the weekdays is not as strong.
Now let’s check out the distribution of sleep minutes per day for the participants of this data set, considering the recommended sleeping hours by our resources.

**Time asleep per day**

```{r}
ggplot(sleep, aes(totalminutesasleep))+ 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density.., fill = ..count..), binwidth=50)+
  geom_density(color= "purple", alpha=0.2, fill="cyan") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(totalminutesasleep, na.rm=T)), 
             color="orange", 
             linetype="dashed")+
  labs(title = "Histogram showing the amount of time asleep per day",
       caption = "Data collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk",
       x= "Time Asleep", y= "Qtd")
```


```{r}

  annotate("text", x=700, y=13, label="Negative correlation", color="blue", size=4)  
```

         x= "Time Asleep", y= "Time in Bed") +
    annotate("text", x=700, y=180, label="Positive correlation", color="blue", size=4)
```
